## Introduction

Mask Detection Image Classification is a project that aims to detect whether people in images are wearing masks or not. This project uses deep learning techniques to classify images into two categories: with mask and without mask.

## Features

- Real-time mask detection
- High accuracy and performance
- Easy to use and integrate
- Supports various image formats

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of thousands of images of people with and without masks. The dataset is balanced and includes diverse images to improve the model's robustness.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Lazygeniusbilal/mask-detection.git
    cd mask-detection
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the mask detection model, follow these steps:

1. **Train the model:**
    ```sh
    python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset --epochs 10
    ```

2. **Test the model:**
    ```sh
    python test.py --image path/to/image
    ```

3. **Run the model in real-time:**
    ```sh
    python realtime_detection.py
    ```
